Two rolls, one for Body Beauty and one for Face Beauty.

Face and "personality" beauty ranges:
-15 and below
results between: (2-6) inch scar, received (from a blade, from an animal bite, from an animal's claws),
missing an ear, misshapen nose, misshapen head, 
-8 to -14
lazy eye, piggish nose, cracking voice, halitosis, always-runny nose; greasy complexion
-1 to -7
bushy eyebrows, large forehead, distinctly large ears, bulbous nose, buck teeth, crooked teeth, acne scars, grating voice, weak chin, eyes which are unnervingly close togther
0 to 7
beautiful aquiline nose, attractively straight teeth, clean and healthy complexion; full lips (for girls), strong chin (for men)
8 to 13
deep, compelling voice (for men); strong jawline (for me); (throaty, seductive voice (for women); charmingly delicate features (for women); perfectly-shaped and brilliantly-white teeth; marvelous high cheekbones
14 and above

The above ranges give characters slightly better odds to be attractive than not.

ALL OF THE ABOVE IMPLEMENTED (WITH SOME CHANGES) AND DEBUGGED AS OF 2016-05-22


Genitalia/Sex characteristics:
I think it's reasonable to generate genitalia information for all characters;
after all, genitals are important!
The genitalia/sexual characteristics roll should be independent of the other two rolls,
giving a 3rd degree of freedom to the whole thing.

A breasts roll:
shriveled, scrawny
sagging
small and knobby
perfectly ordinary
small, perky
large, smooth
ample, perfect

And one for the penis:
micropenis (less than 1 inch)
short and thin (2-3 in) 
noticeably crooked (4-5)
thin, reed-like (4-5)
narrow shaft and large head (3-5)
perfectly ordinary (5)
longish (6)
pleasantly girthy (5-6)
bulging (6-7)
tremendous (7-8)

Simply write two separate methods that return a penis detail or a breasts detail, then a method that calls one or the other based on sex, and returns the result. Then can print this "genital detail" after the physical appearance one.


There's also the questions of hair, eyes, and skin color. I'll leave skin color aside for now.
No reason not to write a simple hair and eye generator, but it's LESS IMPORTANT
than the other characteristics.
